Question 1: Describe the errors that occur when trying to assemble lab5_code.asm. Identify the cause of each error.

 line 14: illegal operands for missing opcode  (x3000 is by itself without .ORIG)
 line 16: instruction appears before .ORIG     (there is no .ORIG pseudo before code)
 line 17: constant outside of allowed range    (x3010 can't be represented in 9 bits)
 line 19: illegal operands for ADD             (there is an extra comma)
 line 30: constant outside of allowed range    (x300F can't be represented in 9 bits)
 line 32: label OUTERLOOP has already appeared (BRpz should be written as BRzp)
 line 35: constant outside of allowed range    (x3011 can't be represented in 9 bits)
 line 43: no .END directive found              (there is no .END after the code)

Question 2: For each label in the code, write down the corresponding memory location. 

 OUTERLOOP - x3004
 INNERLOOP - x3005
 INPUT - x300E

Question 3: Between using labels and explicit memory locations/offsets, which
one makes the most sense, and why?

 Using labels makes the most sense because then if you find out later on that you
 need to add more lines to the begginning of the code, you wont need to adjust the
 offsets accordlingly like you would if you used explicit memory locations.
